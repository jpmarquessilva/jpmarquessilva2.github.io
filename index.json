I am the principal researcher of ANITI\u0026rsquo;s Chair on Deep Learner Explanation and Verification (DeepLEVER) (the team\u0026rsquo;s publications are available here). My research interests include automated reasoning, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Before joining IRIT/CNRS \u0026amp; ANITI, I was affiliated, as Professor of Computer Science, with University College Dublin (IE), the University of Southampton (UK), and the University of Lisbon (PT). I received the PhD from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (USA).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7e59efbb28dede0840f9b2f02e4d89cb","permalink":"/author/joao-marques-silva/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/joao-marques-silva/","section":"authors","summary":"Recent news   ANITI’s Chair on Deep Learner Explanation and Verification (DeepLEVER) is looking for post-doctoral researchers and PhD students to work on applying automated reasoning in explaining and verifying machine learning (ML) models, but also in learning interpretable models and in ML model fairness.","tags":null,"title":"Joao Marques-Silva","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab.
